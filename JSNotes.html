                Here are some thoughts about JS - things that you may need to know
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Editors</span><br>
                <br><br>
                If you are familiar with the literary world - you may think there is an
                author and an editor. The editor is a person who fixes the writing and makes it
                better. That is NOT what we are talking about here.
                <br><br>
                In the computer world a file is a discrete unit of data. A program can READ a
                file. That means it gets the information out of the file. It is modeled after
                reading a book - you don't change the book!
                <br><br>
                A program may also WRITE a file. That means putting information INTO the file.
                That may destroy what was there before, or it may not.
                <br><br>
                Programs can only do one thing at a time (generally). That means they can either
                READ or WRITE the file. But sometimes a program needs to do both. In that case,
                it is called EDITING the file. This is usually done by some kind of delicate balance
                between READING and WRITING.
                <br><br>
                This can get very complicated and very interesting.
                <br><br>
                Find your editor by going to the windows prompt and typing "Notepad" in the search
                bar. Then click on notepad when it comes up.
                <br><br>
                Type something into into notepad and save the file. Make sure you save it in a
                directory you want to use. I suggest you create a new directory or folder in your
                'documents' folder called "learnJS".
                <br><br>
                Save the file in learnJS/junk.txt
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Programs and Files</span><br>
                <br><br>
                There are two things that computers deal with normally (aside from spilled coffee on
                the keyboard!) FILES and PROGRAMS. FILES - are static. They sit. The don't DO anything.
                PROGRAMS DO stuff. Often they do stuff to FILES.
                <br><br>
                Since FILES are static and just sit around all the time, they have to be stored somewhere.
                We store them in DIRECTORIES or FOLDERS. Those are synonyms.
                <br><br>
                In order to access a file, you need to know the name and where it is - the directory.
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Programs</span><br>
                <br><br>
                Programs DO stuff. They often do stuff to FILES, but they do other things also. The
                main thing they do (for us right now) is allow people to see data.
                <br><br>
                WORD is a program. With word you can open a FILE. Then WORD will READ the file, and figure
                out how to show it to the human being. When it is being shown to the person, it is called
                a document. This is what it is in the universe of WORD.
                <br><br>
                If you close the document, all your changes go away. They all disappear - unless you SAVED
                the document. SAVING the document means WRITING it to the file!
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Files</span><br>
                <br><br>
                Files have names and insides. Inside the file is the information the program WRITEs to it.
                The name has two parts. There is a name, a dot, and an extension. For example, this file
                is named JSNotes.html - the filename is "JSNotes" and the extension is "html".
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Command Window</span><br>
                In WINDOWS there is a window called a "Command Window". If you click on your windows prompt,
                <br><br>
                and enter "Command prompt" in the search bar, it will allow you to click on it (somewhere) and
                bring up the Command Window. Try it!
                <br><br>
                Navigate to your "documents/learnJS" folder. The way you navigate in a command window is by
                typing commands one command at a time. First look at what is in your current directory. You
                do that by typing "dir" and pressing enter (try it - but no quotes!)
                <br><br>
                The cursor will be in the first space after the PROMPT. The PROMPT is usually the current
                directory. The CURSOR is that thing that may be blinking right where the first letter you
                type will appear.
                If you want to move into a directory, type CD and the directory name. For example, if I am
                <br><br>
                in C:\Documents> then I can type "cd learnJS" to go into the "learnJS" directory (again, no
                quotes!). From there I can move back up into my Documents directory by typing "cd .." (two
                periods and no quotes).
                <br><br>
                There is a little program (or command) called "type". When followed by a file name, this program
                will write the contents of the file onto the screen. Try it! Type "type junk.txt". Did the stuff
                you wrote get typed out? If you got "file not found" - either you are in a different directory, or
                you saved your file elsewhere, or you named it something different.
                <br><br>
                Retrace your steps and figure it out! Remember "dir" will list the files in the directory.
                <br><br>
                If you get that to work, try saving a WORD document in the same directory. Then open the
                COMMAND prompt, navigate to the directory and "type" that file. You will not be able to
                read it... because WORD saves a lot of formatting and "meta" data.
              <br><br>
              Sincerely,
              <br><br>
