                Here are some thoughts about bonding...
                <br><br>
                Here we are. Waiting. Time to contemplate. Time to not go. Time to not travel if it’s not absolutely necessary. Time to divide the necessary from the absolutely necessary. Necessary? Forget about it. Absolutely Necessary? Go.
                <br><br>
                How does one do social bonding at a time like this? In this new, high-tech world we have so many options! But the problem is that as a world we have never been here before.
                <br><br>
                I would like to invite us to realize how exciting this is! As a world together – the entire world – we are braving a problem the likes of which there has never been! Of course there have been plagues, and blights, and famines. Of course there have been quarantines and separations.
                <br><br>
                But never with the technology so commonly available. And that is exciting!
                <br><br>
                A brief word of what we are fighting – as a world – against… If I were a gambler, I would start taking bets on the rising numbers of drug and alcohol fatalities. I would start looking at the rising rates of depressions or worse due to loneliness. And we have to recognize that loneliness is a serious disease.
                <br><br>
                I have heard that when one visits a sick person, he takes away 10% of the illness. And when one visits a lonely person he takes away 100% of the loneliness.
                <br><br>
                It is my very strong belief that people often die of loneliness. It is arguably the only reason people die.
                <br><br>
                Social Bonding? That is world combat against loneliness. And our enemy is invective, evil, totally destructive, and malicious. For example: what happens when you ask (a lonely) person “Are you lonely?” (I’ll leave the denials to your imagination.) What happens when you are lonely? Do you go out and find friends? Go for a walk? Or do you get needy enough to chase your friends away?
                <br><br>
                Or do you go to sleep?
                <br><br>
                I’m not going to explore that any more. Those who understand, know what I am saying.
                <br><br>
                SO… Social Bonding! That’s what we are about… and I am collecting ideas – how does one do “Social Bonding”? Here are the ideas I have so far… please give me more!
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Internet conferencing</span><br>
                Zoom (Or other conferencing platforms) Conferences – I see people having parties on zoom, or learning, or just getting together to hang out. Zoom is free to download and use. For free you can invite a bunch of people (I have seen up to 30 people) and meet for 40 minutes. As the 40 minutes draws to an end,  Zoom sends a message and then closes the meeting promptly at 40 minutes.
                <br><br>
                In many cases this is very good! With a hard 40 minute cutoff – you are guaranteed to end the meeting. Otherwise, one person may want to hang on… or someone just wants to say one more thing… and on and on.
                <br><br>
                Suggestions: Have a plan: it’s nice to learn something together… one person can talk and everyone else listens. Otherwise one person should be ready to specify who is speaking when. Maybe everyone wants to share their reactions to something (Something in the news? Some common experience?) One person (maybe the host) should specify who shares when. If it becomes a free-for-all – it’s not so helpful (although even that might be better than nothing).
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Telephone</span><br>
                Call someone for no reason! Just call a friend to say “Hi”. If they don’t want to talk, they won’t answer! Maybe they are baking bread and their hands have dough all over them – they don’t want to answer their phone!
                <br><br>
                Now I personally do not like speaking on the phone. In that case…
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Text</span><br>
                Text someone for no reason! I recently texted someone I haven’t spoken to since high-school! (without giving away too much information – that’s a long time ago!) We have been texting often – ever since. It’s been delightful for me – I really like this person and enjoy our communications – and it has also been really helpful – I suddenly have access to an entire (beautiful) world I know nothing about! (Thanks Brooke)
                <br><br>
                Someone else sent me<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykieEE1j9eA" target="_blank"> a link</a> – nothing else… and I have to say it made my whole day! (I very much believe in laughter… always!)
                <br><br>
                I texted someone else I have not seen since high-school. I said “Hi – I haven’t seen you since… in ...”. He responded “Wow”. I responded “Yeah”. And that was the whole conversation… But I daresay he knew I remembered him… it’s nice to be remembered.
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Email</span><br>
                Email – you can certainly send email to someone… don’t know what to say? I suggest you simply say “Hi, I was thinking about you. I hope you’re doing well.” Maybe something will come back – and maybe not! Either way is good, right! Maybe you made his day! If not – let the fact that you sent it make your day!
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Excercise</span><br>
                We have a big warning to maintain a 6-foot physical distance. There’s a lot of things you can do maintaining that distance! What about inviting a group of 5 people to a park to participate in an exercise or stretching routine? I often lead a small stretching group… it’s wonderful!
                <br><br>
                A lot of people talk about yoga… great. My mother did yoga for over 40 years. I come from a theater and juggling background where we co-opt everything… but when it comes to stretching I always go back to mime exercises. Start with feet and work your way up to the head. If people ask – I will be happy to post details here.
                <br><br>
                The great thing about mime exercises is that the actor is working on isolating every muscle to stretch it out. That means – you balance on one leg, and move only your foot… not your head, or hands or shoulders… it’s a very nice focus.
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Singing</span><br>
                What about forming a choir? Get a small group of friends to walk around and sing to people stuck in their houses… Call in advance and say “We are on the way to your house”.
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Theater</span><br>
                Someone else made a whole skit – all at 6-foot distance – and filmed it and sent it to their friends (it then went a little bit viral… so make sure it is something you are comfortable sharing with public).
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>Book/Movie Groups</span><br>
                Invite people to read a book or watch a movie – then get together to talk about it. Remember – loneliness is the belief that nobody is with me and nobody is doing what I am doing. If everyone watches the same movie – that’s nice – but then get together (on zoom) and talk about it! Pick a movie of cultural interest… something with enough stuff to talk about!
                <br><br>
                For those of us who don’t remember how to talk about these things – here are some questions that may result in more conversation:
              <ul>
                <li>What is this movie about? Not the story line, or the ‘theme’ - but what is the stuff – e.g. Field of Dreams might be about lost father-son relationships.</li>
                <li>Who is the main character? (I would suggest the main character is the one who learns something and changes. Interestingly enough, that is almost never the starring role!)</li>
                <li>Why did the story have to take place in that particular scenery? Did it work? e.g. In the 1977 film of Equus – they placed the horse scene in a field with real running horses! Beautiful – but is that appropriate for a show that professes to be about the inner psychology of a kid?</li>
                <li>Was the work real or stylized? Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference!</li>
                <li>(For me a big one is:) Were there any particularly amazing acting moments? One that comes to mind is Meryl Streep (obviously – she is sooo brilliant!) in Into the Woods – there was one moment when she draws everyone in to feel pity, and sadness for her – and she takes that moment and instantaneously moves to “evil witch”… AMAZING!</li>
              </ul>
                <br><br>
                This just in... from <i>NPR...</i> evidently they did a whole show about Physical Distance and Social Bonding, and they didn't mention me once! Anyway - they suggested calling a friend and finding a bench somewhere to sit on - maintaining a 6-foot distance.
                <br><br>
                <span class=suggestionTitle>On the Streets</span>
                <ul>
                  <li>Smile as you aproach or walk by someone else.</li>
                  <li>Say 'Hello' when you are within hearing distance. If you are worried about your breath carrying - face a little away from the person.</li>
                  <li>Wave. Flash a peace sign.</li>
                  <li>Standing in line? Ask the person ahead or behind how they are doing. Smile, and say "Thanks for being in this with me." Most everybody undertands what you are saying.</li>
                  <li>Say 'Thanks' to first line people - grocery store workers, police, garbage, public transportaion, mail... </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                Those are my suggestions so far… If you have more to add, please let me know! I will add them in!
              <br><br>
              Sincerely,
              <br><br>
