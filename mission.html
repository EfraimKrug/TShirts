                <span class=blogTitle>Mission Statement</span>
                <br><br>
                We want to spread compassion, appreciation, gratitude and joy throughout our public sphere in the face of physical distancing.
                <br><br>
                The government has asked us to maintain a 6-foot distance from other people. That is certainly important, but that does not mean we should decrease our sense of comraderie.
                <br><br>
                Now, I am going to explore "6-feet". The distance. My thesis is that standing 6 feet apart is actually incredibly natural, and through the sheer realized humanity of standing six feet apart we can recognize that we are indeed human beings together here on the planet Earth.
                <br><br>
                <span class=blogTitle>Physical distancing, and Social Bonding</span>
                <br><br>
                Physical distancing, and Social Bonding. What’s that about? I mean, everyone is asking for social distance. But I claim we have always been socially distant – we need less of that nonsense! We need social bonding!
                <br><br>
                And now we have the perfect chance to bond socially.
                <br><br>
                You know why six feet is important? Not six-feet-under. Never mind the 72 inches. Or two yards.
                <br><br>
                Do you really think the virus had a meeting – “ok fellas – you don’t go past 6 feet”?
                <br><br>
                Medical professionals have told me a virus can go all the way across a room on a good sneeze. So obviously we need to continue to cover our mouths and noses when expelling air in public.
                <br><br>
                The CDC says six feet. Of course we need to abide by the six feet. But where did this “six feet” number come from?
                <br><br>
                This is what I think. Only me – and I have no supporting evidence from anywhere – but listen and decide if you like it.
                <br><br>
                Most people are about 6 feet tall – we may roughly average 6 feet. Certainly not 7 and not 5. Maybe 5-10 but that’s close to six feet. You know that our arm span is the same as our height? If you are six feet tall, and you hold your arms straight out to your sides your hands are six feet apart.
                <br><br>
                That means if two average people stand face to face (without coughing or sneezing), and they both reach their arms straight out in front of them – they will be close to six feet apart.
                <br><br>
                So far so good? Now listen to this. When two people are standing with their arms straight out in front of them – so that their fingertips are just touching – and they are six feet apart – at that distance they can still see each other’s entire body from tip to toe. That is the closest safe distance (physically).
                <br><br>
                Boxers – maintain that distance before attack. Martial artists maintain that distance. And people who don’t know each other maintain that distance!
                <br><br>
                Watch two people walking down the side walk – towards each other. Just watch. You will see them (usually) look at each other keep their eyes up until they hit that six-foot distance and just then they will drop their eyes and pass.
                <br><br>
                My friends, I think six-feet was chosen because it allows us to express our humanity together is a deeply natural way! Simply by standing six feet apart we say to each other “we are human beings together on the planet Earth”.
                <br><br>
                Let’s remember to maintain the physical distance, but take the extra step. Smile. Show a nice face. Say “thanks for being here with me”. Physical distance. Social bonding.
