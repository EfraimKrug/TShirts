                <br><br>
                I was a teenager. I was walking down the street in New Dehli with my friend. My friend spoke fluent Hindi - I didn't.
                <br><br>
                But we were walking, and I very much was enjoying the walk. I was also very much committed to being successful by my own steam - so to speak. In other words, if I was getting tired of walking there is no way I was going to admit that. I would walk. Period.
                <br><br>
                That was my attitude when I was in high-school. Often it still is.
                <br><br>
                But then, that day in New Dehli something did happen - to change me. I carry this story with me always.
                <br><br>
                There was a bicycle rickshaw driver who rode up next to us.
                <br><br>
                Now, if you don't know - bicycle rickshaws are like big tricycles, but they have space for two passengers in back. The driver peddles, and then the passengers pay him for the ride. They are really hard work.
                <br><br>
                So this driver rode up next to us, asked us if we wanted to ride - I know that because my friend translated. My friend asked me. I said no. That was that, right? No.
                <br><br>
                The driver kept speaking. My friend asked me again. I said no. The driver kept speaking. And my friend was almost crying.
                <br><br>
                Finally, the driver left. I asked my friend what was wrong.
                <br><br>
                "If nobody hires my services, if rich people like you don't hire my services, how will I ever make a living? How will I feed my family?"
                <br><br>
                That's what the driver was saying.
                <br><br>
                I was a little kid when I lived in East Pakistan - now Bangladesh. When I was living there - it looked a lot like parts of Calcutta now... Of course, I am remembering the heat, the flies, the sewage, the beggars - beggars - beggars -
                <br><br>
                The broken houses, the cows in the streets... Beggars.
                <br><br>
                This is Calcutta - but Dacca (now Dhaka) was like that. Everywhere... I am not going to show pictures of the beggars - they are so prevalent - but this is not a place to display their pain...
                <br><br>
                Floods. Famine. On and on.
                <br><br>
                Then textile industry started to come... a little bit. I assume the first sweat shops were no better than the ones in the US or Europe in the early industrial period... children work and bring money home to their parents.
                <br><br>
                So I have to say - I was curious to find a picture of a modern day manufacturer.
                <br><br>
                Beautiful, right? It looks to me like these people are being taken care of! It turns out that
                <br><br>
                There is industry and the economy is growing more than I could have ever imagined! Awesome... Until Dhaka looks like this:
                <br><br>
                There are the bicycle rickshaws I was talking about. When I was little I would jump on the back and the driver would really get angry at me... but he had customers so he could not really say anything! Cute kid? Not...
                <br><br>
                If I could find any way to apologize to those guys I would. What did I know? About work. About trying to make a living.
                <br><br>
                About trying to make my $17/month - minimum wage in Bangladesh.
                <br><br>
                So I do want to end up with a penultimate word of praise, a word of appreciation for accomplishment, endurance, for the will to keep going - that has turned Dhaka into this kind of a city - against insurmountable odds.
                <br><br>
                And the parthian shot - if nobody buys their textiles, how will they keep developing? If nobody hires the rickshaw, how can he feed his family?

                <br><br>
                April 30, 2020 -
                <br><br>
                It was about three weeks ago. Maybe four, but it seems like a long time ago – you know – time can travel so slowly. People were just starting to stay away from each other. Many were still hanging out in Starbucks, drinking coffee, afraid of loneliness. But slowly people would just look at each other – with suspicion.
                <br><br>
                “Stay out of my space”.
                <br><br>
                “Get back”. “You probably have it”.
                <br><br>
                A friendly town – turned overnight into a den of callous gun-hands – “git out of my face”.
                <br><br>
                All I need is cards, a bottle of cheap whiskey and my gun.
                <br><br>
                Actually, I never was a guy like that – and the ones I have met aren’t either!
                <br><br>
                Listen to this: I had a roommate for a week in San Francisco – at the Grey Rabbit Inn – who told me what he used to do for a living. He said he used to explain to people what would happen to them if they didn’t pay back their loans.
                <br><br>
                Sounds like a banker? Right - he looked like a banker. Except that he was actually explaining all the  vile and illegal things mobs can perpetuate. He may have been about the “toughest” guy I have ever met.
                <br><br>
                Except for the cowboy in Montana who claimed he could touch the ground and make earthquakes.
                <br><br>
                Or the mob in Mexico (actually these guys were the scariest).
                <br><br>
                Or in Bangkok.
                <br><br>
                But he was really tough. The thing is – when we went to the zoo together there was a long line of people waiting to see the pandas. So we stood outside the fence – and stood on each other’s shoulders to see.
                <br><br>
                He took off his shoes, and climbed up onto my shoulders. Then I took off my shoes and climbed onto his shoulders. That’s how we saw the pandas.
                <br><br>
                Now I ask you, what kind of a ‘tough guy’ climbs up on someone’s shoulders to see pandas?
                <br><br>
                But, and back to my general pointlessness, I want to ask you with all sincerity – would you rather be a ‘tough guy’ or have friends? Wouldn’t you rather be laughing with friends? Or singing?
                <br><br>
                Wouldn’t you rather listen to a friend tell a story? Or just talk? Do you really want to walk on our streets and look at the people around you disapprovingly, suspiciously, angrily, the old evil eye?
                <br><br>
                But now – everyone says “social distance” right? Perfect! You have complete allowance to walk around giving strangers the old evil eye. “Stay back!” That’s what the government is saying “Maintain social distance.”
                <br><br>
                My friend says we don’t need any more social distance – we need physical distance, and social bonding.
                <br><br>
                And that is what this website is about. Physical distance, and social bonding.
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                <br><br>

                <span class=blogTitle>The web of 2013 to Social Bonding</span>
                <br><br>
                Right now I am starting a website called "NameThatThing.site". It is a very nice web site. So far. And Since it is a nice website, I thought I would start a <a href="http://physicaldistancesocialbonding.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-web-of-2015-to-social-bonding.html" target=_blank>blog somewhere</a>. That way, I can tie the blog to my website, and the website to my blog - and - you know - keep everything tied together.
                <br><br>
                So I started looking for a blogsite. I found this blog site. I tried to open an account. And low and behold - this site connected me to a blog I wrote in 2013!
                <br><br>
                Well shiver m'timbers! Imagine that - something I wrote in 2013 coming back to haunt me right now in 2020. But, be that as it may, I am going to jump right back into the thick of things, and try to transition my way from "This wonderful web" to "Physical Distance and Social Bonding".
                <br><br>
                Because this is a blog about Physical Distance and Social Bonding. I should know. I'm the author. Besides, just look at the title!
                <br><br>
                cough. cough. look around the room. clear the throat. cough.
                <br><br>
                Now the first thing I would like to do is to mention the old topic of "This wonderful web". It truly is a wonderful web. The amount of knowledge on this web is truly remarkable. Now we can google just about anything and get an answer.
                <br><br>
                For example, when I googled "is google a verb", the response was:
                <br><br>
                goo·gle<br>
                /ˈɡo͞oɡ(ə)l/<br>
                <br><br>
                verb<br>
                verb: google; 3rd person present: googles; past tense: googled; past participle: googled; gerund or present participle: googling
                search for information about (someone or something) on the Internet using the search engine Google.
                <br><br>
                "I recently googled my 7th grade teacher and found his current email address"
                <br><br>
                Amazing, right? When I was in 7th grade one would never think of 'googling his teacher'! Never.
                <br><br>
                That being said - the fact of all the information available to us is really awesome. 
                <br><br>
                And as always, one has to decide what kind of information (s)he wants to wallow in. There are many types of information - there are factoids, there are in-depth discussions, there are personal accounts, and there is gossip. A lot of gossip. Lots and lots of gossip.
                <br><br>
                Let me explain what I mean by gossip. I mean - there is obviously saying bad things about other people. That's gossip - but I don't have to talk about that.
                <br><br>
                Then there is so much information posted by people who really don't know what they are talking about. That is just like gossip. 
                <br><br>
                It's easy. It's cheap thrills. It gets response. It can be vicious. And it can be very destructive. I am going to let you imagine what I am talking about... while i veer the monologue off to the side - and end up with "You can't do Social Bonding with lots of gossip." 
                <br><br>
                And there I did it! From "This wonderful web" successfully to "Social Bonding". And Social Bonding fits so nicely (these days) with Physical Distancing. And I would like to invite you to read my next blog on Physical Distancing and Social Bonding.
                <br><br>
                Until tomorrow,
                <br><br>
