                <span class=blogTitle>Fingerprinting</span>
                <br><br>
                Step by step. I got in touch with my aliyah advisor who said that there is a new requirement for aliyah. The oleh needs a background check from the FBI. In the old days that might have meant a special trip to a Federal building someplace, but now it means clicking on the link and opening the proper web page. Quite a convenience!
                <br><br>
                I did that. The FBI web page takes my money ($18 – chai – life – interesting) and then says I need to get fingerprinted. I’m waiting for the web page that can do that! But no, I actually have to pick myself up out of my chair, and walk to a fingerprinting office.
                <br><br>
                The closest one is downtown. The subway is running, so I go to get on the train. I have my ticket – I go to the front door… and it stays closed. There is a sign – use the next door. Cool – they are protecting the driver. Imagine this poor driver, in the midst of this COVID fear, has to sit while every passenger comes right close to them and takes the time (breathing the same air and spreading possible virus) to pay their tab. So that’s great!
                <br><br>
                But there are also signs blocking people from sitting too close to the driver.
                <br><br>
                And since there are only a few people on the train it is great. I have distance. The driver has distance. I get a seat. Nobody has to stand up for me because they think I am old!
                <br><br>
                I get off the train downtown, and as I am going onto the escalator a man calls out to me “I’m so glad you’re not terrified like everybody else”.
                <br><br>
                “You do what you have to do…”
                <br><br>
                Walking down the street there is only one person asking for money. She is extremely appreciative when I give her – she smiles warmly and says thanks.
                <br><br>
                Finally I get to the post office. I put on my mask – I have to pull the door open so I put on a glove – and I enter. The attendant at the desk tells me to go around the corner to the other door. He looks bored out of his mind. I say “thanks” and leave.
                <br><br>
                I walk in the other door, and Albert greets me “What do you need?”
                <br><br>
                “Fingerprints”.
                <br><br>
                “What kind of ID do you have?”
                <br><br>
                “Driver’s licesnce”.
                <br><br>
                “Are you pre-registered?”
                <br><br>
                “Yes”.
                <br><br>
                He gives me clear, concise directions:
                <br><br>
                “Go there, hand me your licesnce and tell me your order number. Then I will meet you there”.
                <br><br>
                He carefully cleans off the window of the machine, and tells me how to put my left fingertips on the glass after the light turns green. It doesn’t work. He says “You  were wearing gloves, right?” I respond in the affirmative. He says “If you can rub your fingers together a bit – that may be helpful. I also have this lotion – are you willing to use it?”
                <br><br>
                “What’s it do?”
                <br><br>
                “I don’t know, but the FBI says it works”.
                <br><br>
                I’m captivated. I knew that your fingerprints go away when you are wearing gloves. That makes sense – your fingertips are not actually touching the service. It would be like trying to stamp a piece of paper through a napkin. I tried once. It ruined the napkin (and did nothing to the paper).
                <br><br>
                But why would wearing gloves diminish the print after you take the gloves off? He suggested sweat – my hand was sweating so the print is diminished. You got me. My fantasy about fingerprints is that they are found at crime scences. Because the criminal was careless.
                <br><br>
                This makes it seem that you have to be very careful to get a good print. What criminal is going to be so careful?!? Ok, my friend, a lawyer, told me he once represented a bank robber who was about to get caught by the police. He quickly had the bankers tie him up, put him in the safe, and asked them to tell the police that the thief had tied this guy up and run away.
                <br><br>
                This case, evidently, was written up as one of the dumbest thieves in the world!
                <br><br>
                With fingerprinting, I thought we were talking about thieves with above average intelligence! Before I finish robbing this bank, let me just carefully wash my hand and leave a really clean fingerprint…
                <br><br>
                It turns out that fingerprinting has an entire history of abuse. When it was first discovered it seems there were same very impressive uses of the new technology to solve crimes – by the British police in Bengal where they are credited for a large part of the development of the science. (They came up with an ingenius way of categorizing them so they could look through them quickly).
                <br><br>
                In the early 20th century, lawyers were using them dramatically – with blown up pictures and witnesses.
                <br><br>
                In the 90’s there seems to have been at least one case where the fingerprints were thown out of the evidence completely. The question is how do you match a print taken from the scene of the crime, to a print taken in a lab. How many points of similarity do they need in order to be identified as the same person?
                <br><br>
                Difference labs in different states use different numbers of points. The more points used, the more reliable. In the current political/race landscape of America it would be very interesting to fiind out if states with larger black/hispanic populations use the higher number or the lower number.
                <br><br>
                In other words, I would suspect states that use the higher number are being more careful not to convict the wrong person, and I would guess states  that are less careful have larger black/hispanic populations.
                <br><br>
                As we say – it needs investigation.

                <span class=blogTitle>Asking You to Like Me</span>
                <br><br>
                Likes. Like me. Give me a like.
                <br><br>
                I'm starting to feel like I'm in high school again. Please like me.
                <br><br>
                But this is professional!
                <br><br>
                The ever present "they" evidently did a "study" and found that there are people who release endorphins because they were "liked" on facebook... that's not surprising - but if I remember correctly the number of endorphins released were comparable to the experience of ... wait for it ... that's right!
                <br><br>
                Going on a hot date.
                <br><br>
                "Not tonight honey, I'm waiting for my likes to come in on my facebook page."
                <br><br>
                Come to think of it - releasing endorphins into the wild... that sounds interesting too.
                <br><br>
                Hiking along the Appalachian Trail calmly releasing endorphins as we  munched on our granola bars...
                <br><br>
                Anyway, I just asked all my friends on facebook to like my facebook page. That took a certain amount of courage for me. I don't really like going around asking people to like me. Especially my friends.
                <br><br>
                They might stop being my friends. It is usually the case that neediness is not particularly attractive. In fact, I have found it is a really good way to completely alienate your friends.
                <br><br>
                But, it turns out - that I actually got my first like - from an old friend from high school - who is currently living in Thailand. That's actually pretty cool!
                <br><br>
                She was in my Calculus class, and now (I believe) she is teaching Calculus!
                <br><br>
                In any case, big thanks to Samagita Ratnaike! And to everyone else who "likes" my page!
                <br><br>
                And remember, my friends, "like" in this case, means moving a plastic object across a table and pushing a button.
                <br><br>
                Not overly friendly!

                <span class=blogTitle>Exploration</span>
                <br><br>
                Exploration. Exploration of the west. Of space. Of the sea. Of the mind.
                <br><br>
                Exploration of philosophical ideas. Exploration... going step by step in a place you have never been before. That is what exploration is.
                <br><br>
                And the crazy thing is - we all do it all the time! You can't stay alive on this crazy planet without an enormous amount of exploration.
                <br><br>
                Question: When was the age of exploration?
                <br><br>
                Answer: Always, for everybody.
                <br><br>
                "Wait a minute", you say. "No explorer am I".
                <br><br>
                No. You are. I am. He is. All of us. Let's think of all the places we have explored.
                <br><br>
                New Restaurants. New Hotels. First time I flew. First time I... anything.
                <br><br>
                But a million people have been there before - so why is that exploring?
                <br><br>
                Because I have never been there before. I am not like anyone else because I am me, and also because every human being is so unique. If I have never been there before, I have no idea where I am going or what the next step will be like.
                <br><br>
                With this in mind, together we can start exploring the world of Social Bonding with Physical Distancing. When you wear your "Physical Distancing, and Social Bonding" shirt, please, send me the stories!

                Sincerely,

                <span class=blogTitle>Textiles from Bangladesh</span>
                <br><br>
                I was a teenager. I was walking down the street in New Dehli with my friend. My friend spoke fluent Hindi - I didn't.
                <br><br>
                But we were walking, and I very much was enjoying the walk. I was also very much committed to being successful by my own steam - so to speak. In other words, if I was getting tired of walking there is no way I was going to admit that. I would walk. Period.
                <br><br>
                That was my attitude when I was in high-school. Often it still is.
                <br><br>
                But then, that day in New Dehli something did happen - to change me. I carry this story with me always.
                <br><br>
                There was a bicycle rickshaw driver who rode up next to us.
                <br><br>
                Now, if you don't know - bicycle rickshaws are like big tricycles, but they have space for two passengers in back. The driver peddles, and then the passengers pay him for the ride. They are really hard work.
                <br><br>
                So this driver rode up next to us, asked us if we wanted to ride - I know that because my friend translated. My friend asked me. I said no. That was that, right? No.
                <br><br>
                The driver kept speaking. My friend asked me again. I said no. The driver kept speaking. And my friend was almost crying.
                <br><br>
                Finally, the driver left. I asked my friend what was wrong.
                <br><br>
                "If nobody hires my services, if rich people like you don't hire my services, how will I ever make a living? How will I feed my family?"
                <br><br>
                That's what the driver was saying.
                <br><br>
                I was a little kid when I lived in East Pakistan - now Bangladesh. When I was living there - it looked a lot like parts of Calcutta now... Of course, I am remembering the heat, the flies, the sewage, the beggars - beggars - beggars -
                <br><br>
                The broken houses, the cows in the streets... Beggars.
                <br><br>
                This is Calcutta - but Dacca (now Dhaka) was like that. Everywhere... I am not going to show pictures of the beggars - they are so prevalent - but this is not a place to display their pain...
                <br><br>
                Floods. Famine. On and on.
                <br><br>
                Then textile industry started to come... a little bit. I assume the first sweat shops were no better than the ones in the US or Europe in the early industrial period... children work and bring money home to their parents.
                <br><br>
                So I have to say - I was curious to find a picture of a modern day manufacturer.
                <br><br>
                Beautiful, right? It looks to me like these people are being taken care of! It turns out that
                <br><br>
                There is industry and the economy is growing more than I could have ever imagined! Awesome... Until Dhaka looks like this:
                <br><br>
                There are the bicycle rickshaws I was talking about. When I was little I would jump on the back and the driver would really get angry at me... but he had customers so he could not really say anything! Cute kid? Not...
                <br><br>
                If I could find any way to apologize to those guys I would. What did I know? About work. About trying to make a living.
                <br><br>
                About trying to make my $17/month - minimum wage in Bangladesh.
                <br><br>
                So I do want to end up with a penultimate word of praise, a word of appreciation for accomplishment, endurance, for the will to keep going - that has turned Dhaka into this kind of a city - against insurmountable odds.
                <br><br>
                And the parthian shot - if nobody buys their textiles, how will they keep developing? If nobody hires the rickshaw, how can he feed his family?
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                <br><br>

                April 30, 2020 -
                <br><br>
                It was about three weeks ago. Maybe four, but it seems like a long time ago – you know – time can travel so slowly. People were just starting to stay away from each other. Many were still hanging out in Starbucks, drinking coffee, afraid of loneliness. But slowly people would just look at each other – with suspicion.
                <br><br>
                “Stay out of my space”.
                <br><br>
                “Get back”. “You probably have it”.
                <br><br>
                A friendly town – turned overnight into a den of callous gun-hands – “git out of my face”.
                <br><br>
                All I need is cards, a bottle of cheap whiskey and my gun.
                <br><br>
                Actually, I never was a guy like that – and the ones I have met aren’t either!
                <br><br>
                Listen to this: I had a roommate for a week in San Francisco – at the Grey Rabbit Inn – who told me what he used to do for a living. He said he used to explain to people what would happen to them if they didn’t pay back their loans.
                <br><br>
                Sounds like a banker? Right - he looked like a banker. Except that he was actually explaining all the  vile and illegal things mobs can perpetuate. He may have been about the “toughest” guy I have ever met.
                <br><br>
                Except for the cowboy in Montana who claimed he could touch the ground and make earthquakes.
                <br><br>
                Or the mob in Mexico (actually these guys were the scariest).
                <br><br>
                Or in Bangkok.
                <br><br>
                But he was really tough. The thing is – when we went to the zoo together there was a long line of people waiting to see the pandas. So we stood outside the fence – and stood on each other’s shoulders to see.
                <br><br>
                He took off his shoes, and climbed up onto my shoulders. Then I took off my shoes and climbed onto his shoulders. That’s how we saw the pandas.
                <br><br>
                Now I ask you, what kind of a ‘tough guy’ climbs up on someone’s shoulders to see pandas?
                <br><br>
                But, and back to my general pointlessness, I want to ask you with all sincerity – would you rather be a ‘tough guy’ or have friends? Wouldn’t you rather be laughing with friends? Or singing?
                <br><br>
                Wouldn’t you rather listen to a friend tell a story? Or just talk? Do you really want to walk on our streets and look at the people around you disapprovingly, suspiciously, angrily, the old evil eye?
                <br><br>
                But now – everyone says “social distance” right? Perfect! You have complete allowance to walk around giving strangers the old evil eye. “Stay back!” That’s what the government is saying “Maintain social distance.”
                <br><br>
                My friend says we don’t need any more social distance – we need physical distance, and social bonding.
                <br><br>
                And that is what this website is about. Physical distance, and social bonding.
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,

                <span class=blogTitle>The web of 2013 to Social Bonding</span>
                <br><br>
                Right now I am starting a website called "NameThatThing.site". It is a very nice web site. So far. And Since it is a nice website, I thought I would start a <a href="http://physicaldistancesocialbonding.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-web-of-2015-to-social-bonding.html" target=_blank>blog somewhere</a>. That way, I can tie the blog to my website, and the website to my blog - and - you know - keep everything tied together.
                <br><br>
                So I started looking for a blogsite. I found this blog site. I tried to open an account. And low and behold - this site connected me to a blog I wrote in 2013!
                <br><br>
                Well shiver m'timbers! Imagine that - something I wrote in 2013 coming back to haunt me right now in 2020. But, be that as it may, I am going to jump right back into the thick of things, and try to transition my way from "This wonderful web" to "Physical Distance and Social Bonding".
                <br><br>
                Because this is a blog about Physical Distance and Social Bonding. I should know. I'm the author. Besides, just look at the title!
                <br><br>
                cough. cough. look around the room. clear the throat. cough.
                <br><br>
                Now the first thing I would like to do is to mention the old topic of "This wonderful web". It truly is a wonderful web. The amount of knowledge on this web is truly remarkable. Now we can google just about anything and get an answer.
                <br><br>
                For example, when I googled "is google a verb", the response was:
                <br><br>
                goo·gle<br>
                /ˈɡo͞oɡ(ə)l/<br>
                <br><br>
                verb<br>
                verb: google; 3rd person present: googles; past tense: googled; past participle: googled; gerund or present participle: googling
                search for information about (someone or something) on the Internet using the search engine Google.
                <br><br>
                "I recently googled my 7th grade teacher and found his current email address"
                <br><br>
                Amazing, right? When I was in 7th grade one would never think of 'googling his teacher'! Never.
                <br><br>
                That being said - the fact of all the information available to us is really awesome. 
                <br><br>
                And as always, one has to decide what kind of information (s)he wants to wallow in. There are many types of information - there are factoids, there are in-depth discussions, there are personal accounts, and there is gossip. A lot of gossip. Lots and lots of gossip.
                <br><br>
                Let me explain what I mean by gossip. I mean - there is obviously saying bad things about other people. That's gossip - but I don't have to talk about that.
                <br><br>
                Then there is so much information posted by people who really don't know what they are talking about. That is just like gossip. 
                <br><br>
                It's easy. It's cheap thrills. It gets response. It can be vicious. And it can be very destructive. I am going to let you imagine what I am talking about... while i veer the monologue off to the side - and end up with "You can't do Social Bonding with lots of gossip." 
                <br><br>
                And there I did it! From "This wonderful web" successfully to "Social Bonding". And Social Bonding fits so nicely (these days) with Physical Distancing. And I would like to invite you to read my next blog on Physical Distancing and Social Bonding.
                <br><br>
                Until tomorrow,
                <br><br>
